Hey, this is the frontend part of the repo. 
This isnt complete and It's basically the static cards and the form. The form has only sliders and a min rating option.

How to start this?

Step 1: Clone this repo
Step 2: Download it in your computer
Step 3: Run *npm start* after going to the root directory.
